# DaDImpute
DaDImpute (Data Diffusion on imputing scRNAseq), is a novel computational approach incorporating information on the inherent cell-cell relationship as well as external information on gene-gene relationship estimate the true values of the false-zero counts. We corroborate DadImputeâ€™s ability to effectively recuperate the missing value and recover the gene expression patterns, by imputing masked glioblastoma data and comparing the result with the original values.
